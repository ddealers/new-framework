		p
			| How about a honeymoon on the Moon? This may one day be possible: Hilton International, the international hotel company, has announced plans to build the first hotel on the Moon.
		p
			| The announcement follows the recent discovery of water, which has greatly increased the possibility of colonizing the Moon.
		p
			| The Lunar Hilton would have five thousand rooms, restaurants, a church and even a beach. Food would come from farms on the Moon&apos;s surface and the ice discovered at the Moon&apos;s poles could be used for water. The hotel would be powered by solar panels.
		p
			| Two Japanese companies have also expressed interest in this development in the space race.
		p
			| Shimuzu is planning an orbiting 64-room space hotel by 2020 and a hotel on the Moon&apos;s surface. Nishimatu Construction Company also has plans for a Moon resort, called Escargot City a reference to the shape of the ten towers they plan to build.
		p
			| So what does the Moon offer tourists who would like to experience a lunar holiday? After completing the holiday, guests could enjoy a variety of activities from golf and tennis to excursions on special moon buses. They would first have to get used to wearing special boots because of the lack of gravity on the Moon.
		p
			| The Hilton has already been in contact with NASA about transportation of passengers and building materials but scientists have reacted with surprise and disbelief. They have mentioned both the incredible expense and the dangers of space travel.
		p
			| However, tourists looking for a room with a really special view would love it. Also, honeymoon couples wanting to give a new meaning to the word might find the Moon a perfect destination.
