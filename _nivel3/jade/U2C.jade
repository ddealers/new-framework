						b The House from Hell
					p
						| Imagine moving into a strange apartment with five total strangers for three months.
					p
						| What&apos;s more, every move you make is being filmed by a video camera, day and night. And then broadcast around the world on the Internet. Sound like three months in hell? This is what six Sydneysiders have agreed to do, in the hope of winning $5000 each from a local radio station.
					p
						| The ideacalled &quot;The House from Hell&quot;is the brainchild of Andrew Denton, of Sydney&apos;s Triple M radio. &quot;We&apos;ve all experienced roommates from hell,&quot; says Denton. &quot;Now Triple M will give you six of them living in one squalid house, tearing each other apart. Now that&apos;s entertainment!&quot;
					p
						| Who would want to do such a thing? Stuart Robinson, for a start. This 28 year-old Australian, who says he gets along with almost anyone, couldn&apos;t resist the temptation of rent-free housing for three months. &quot;I was out of work anyway, so I thought, what the heck!&quot;
					p
						| The conditions are strict, and to break any of them means a &quot;fine&quot; is deducted from the $5000 prize money. Participants have to stay in five nights a week for the duration of the experiment. Their loved ones are allowed to visit only twice a week, but they can stay the nightif they dare! Participants are permitted to bring five items of their choice into the house. Each week one participant is chosen to spend a limit of $400 a week on groceries.
					p
						| Meanwhile, four security camerasin the kitchen, lounge, dining room, and one of the bedroomsbeam non-stop images on to the Internet. Regular updates on their doings are broadcast on Triple M radio. As if this wasn&apos;t enough, the contestants are required to complete certain tasks, or risk earning a fine. This weekend, for example, all six have to wear inflatable costumes. David Clark, 40 and the oldest of the group, is dressed in a Santa suit and is finding it pretty difficult to get around. Stuart (in a clown suit) says: &quot;It was pretty amusingfor the first five minutes!&quot;
					p
						| Now they are into their second week, and so far no one has dropped out. &quot;It&apos;s amazing how well we all get along,&quot; says David. But they still can&apos;t get used to all the attention they are getting. Says Natasha, 20, and the baby of the house, &quot;With half the world watching you all the time, it makes you slightly nervous.&quot;
