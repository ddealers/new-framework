			b Duet
		p
			| Kristina Olsen and Peter Grayling (KOPGCD01)
		p
			| Singer/guitarist and cello duets are not the expected ingredients of a folk CD, but this combination of American singer Olsen and West Australian cellist Grayling proves to be a delightful combination. Olsen&apos;s voice and the cello exchange lines, matching tonalities, with the cello weaving a lower line, sometimes a harmony, sometimes a rhythmic counterpoint.
		p
			| Olsen&apos;s choice of songs seems a little more reflective than on previous releases, perhaps as a response to working with the sonorities of the cello. Her great strength as a songwriter is the ability to convey the sense of a broken heart, usually her own, in a direct yet humorous manner.
		p
			| The outstanding track on this CD is a song called &quot;Heart Hill&quot;, a very English-sounding song about a place glimpsed off an English highway, but the whole CD is a fine addition to her catalog along with the notable collaboration with Grayling.

				i Flight Paths
				|  - The Paradise Motel (Mushroom)
		p
			| British music magazine 
			i New Musical Express
			|  may have been a little harsh when it said that The Paradise Motel&apos;s Merida Sussex&apos;s voice made Julie Cruise sound like Tina Turner. But it is a fairly accurate description of her haunting vocal style. While other bands use the voice to merely add on top of the noise, Sussex&apos;s vocals are arguably the most important component in the Motel&apos;s impressive musical machinery.
		p
			| The haunting legacy which began with 
			i Still Life
			|  (1996), continues on 
			i Flight Paths
			|  and the dark musical tapestry, created by Charles Bickford and enhanced by Victor van Vugt&apos;s rich production, has progressed with almost a hint of salvation (Derwent River Star, Daniel, Caravans, Hollywood Landmines) expressed in Sussex&apos;s uplifting vocals.
		p
			| So while The Paradise Motel will never be the latest teen fad, with more style than to bother with crowd-diving and noisy guitars, this dark, yet cathartic, musical masterpiece will have a more lasting influence on Australian musical history than we may yet acknowledge.

			b Peter Sculthorpe: String Quartets
		p
			| Played by the Goldner String Quartet (Tall Poppies TPO90)
		p
			| The Goldner Quartet was formed by Musica Viva in 1995, and consists of four of this country&apos;s finest younger string players.
		p
			| This disc is the second volume of Sculthorpe&apos;s complete works for string quartets, recorded in the presence of the composer. Included is the String Quartet No 10, written in 1983 for the US-based Kronos Quartet and displaying musical influences &quot;from both sides of the Pacific.&quot; It is balanced by the String Quartet No 11 of 1990 which is distinctively Australian in feeling and with the subtitle Jabiru Dreaming is one of the composer&apos;s &quot;Kakadu&quot; works.
		p
			| Both are very approachable, and receive committed and finely shaped performances which capture effectively the essential elements of the music. With the composer&apos;s supervision the performances can be regarded as definitive.
		p
			| The disc also offers ten small pieces for string quartet, two of them miniatures called Hill-Songs, and the remainder drawn from unpublished or discarded works. With equally fine and carefully crafted performances, they provide, with the full-scale quartets, a constantly interesting survey of Sculthorpe&apos;s music for string quartet from 1945 to 1994.
