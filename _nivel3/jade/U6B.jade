			b Angela&apos;s Ashes
		p
			| Based on the Pulitzer-prize winning novel by Frank McCourt, Angela&apos;s Ashes is the latest movie by director Alan Parker (Evita, Mississippi Burning). Set in Ireland in the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s, the movie tells the story of Frank&apos;s childhood and adolescence in rural Ireland.
		p
			| The movie opens with Frank&apos;s family living in Brooklyn. When Frank&apos;s baby sister dies, the family decides to give up a poor and difficult life in America and return to Ireland.
		p
			| Parker&apos;s movie is faithful to the book, consisting of a series of episodes in Frank&apos;s life rather than a continuous narrative. Although it&apos;s a dramatic and moving story, it&apos;s told with humor and optimism. Robert Carlyle, who recently starred as the bad guy in the new James Bond movie, plays Frank&apos;s lovable but heavy-drinking father, and English actress Emily Watson plays his mother.
		p
			| Parker&apos;s movie is a classic &quot;rites of passage&quot; movie. In a key scene, Frank&apos;s father takes the boy to the pub for the first time, marking young Frank&apos;s acceptance into the adult world. The action is helped along by music from guitarist and composer John Williams.
		p
			| Angela&apos;s Ashes follows the recent trend of adapting successful novels for movies. But is it as good as the book? Parker wisely avoids the temptation to romanticize the family&apos;s difficult life, but he fails to recreate the atmosphere and spirit of McCourt&apos;s writing.
		p
			| Hollywood directors love successful novelists and pay millions to adapt their books for the screen. However, it can be extremely difficult to match the quality of prize-winning books like Frank McCourt&apos;s. Many people will enjoy Alan Parker&apos;s movie. But they would enjoy the book more.
