<b class="inst5">Adding emphasis</b>
<p>
<b class="tablau2">1. Using do for contrastive emphasis.</b>
<p>
<div class="co1">
<span class="rojo"><b>Do</b></span> is also used in this way when we want to imagine the consequences of an impossible or very unlikely situation:
<p>
<span class="rojo">If the asteroid <b>did</b> collide with Earth it would do so at more than 17,000 mph.</span>
<p>
<span class="rojo"><b>Do</b></span> is not necessary when there is already an auxiliary verb:
<p>
<span class="rojo">If the asteroid <b>was</b> on a collision course with Earth, a way to alter its orbit would have to be found.<br>
He's not my type of person, but you're right, he is very charming.</span>
<p>
To emphasize an auxiliary verb, decontract it and stress it:
<p>
<span class="rojo">He's not very charming.<br>
On the contrary, I think he <b><i>is</i></b> very charming.</span>
<p>
<b>Make the phrases in bold more emphatic by using do and by expanding contractions where necessary.</b>
<p>
<span class="rojo">I'm not surprised I failed the exam, <b>but I'm annoyed</b> about it.<br>
