<b>Speaker 1</b><br>
Well, my friends say that I watch an unhealthy amount of, of telly - well, not just telly but soap operas, I mean soap operas are ... I guess you could say I'm, I'm addicted. I watch several hours every day, I will admit that, and then, I mean, if by any misfortune I miss an episode then I will watch the extended repeat version at the weekends, or.... I buy several magazines, um, about TV and the soap stars - you know, what's going to happen in the next few episodes, who's marrying who or murdering who or whatever - I find it very exciting. Um, I know my friends don't find it so exciting - in fact, they complain that they never see me because I'm always at home watching telly. And if I go on holiday then I have to bribe either my flatmate or my parents to record all the episodes I miss, which means that I then have to stay in watching them all when I get back, which is great - I have something to look forward to when I come back.

Talking about obsessions, my mum is literally obsessed with cleaning and tidying. She spends the whole day hoovering the house and, er, dusting. I think she's worried that someone might turn up at any moment, er, and that if they do she wants the house to be in perfect working order. Um, the result of this is that I don't feel comfortable when I go and visit my parents. Um, if I'm eating a sandwich then she's, she's along and mopping, mopping up the crumbs. Um, if I'm reading the paper, for example, she tells me not to touch anything afterwards because my fingers might be dirty and, um, it's very nerve-racking.

I've got a friend who's absolutely addicted to going to the cinema. She goes about four or five times a week. She sometimes goes on her own, or she often goes on her own, actually, which is a bit of a problem with her boyfriend because he doesn't like her going to the cinema on her own. And we don't like it sometimes 'cause sometimes we'd like to do something different, like to go out of the city and go walking, but she always wants to go to the cinema. She's quite happy to go on her own as well.<p>
