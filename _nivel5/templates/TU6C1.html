I was born in London, in south London, um, I lived in a tower block in south London, and I remember when I was young that, that me and me friends, we were always bored and trying to think of things to do to kill time, you know, messing about, um, sometimes doing dangerous things. I remember one day, we, um, that was when I was sixteen, before I could drive, um, we stole, er, my neighbour's car and went joyriding. Um, I think maybe if, luckily the police caught us and stopped us, cause, you know, I think we'd have had a crash otherwise. Another thing we used to do was skateboarding, um, which doesn't sound very dangerous, does it? But we made it more dangerous by holding onto the back of, um, buses and cars and getting them to pull us along. Um, obviously the drivers got pretty angry with us and shouted and swore at us, and told us not to muck about, but we didn't listen to them, you know, we, we enjoyed it, and we used to do it several times a week. Um, but everything we did was in the city. We never got out into the country, and we never did things like, I don't know, horseriding, things like that. Um, and I think things have changed. I mean, kids still do dangerous things, stupid things, um, I know it's very popular to do lift surfing today - we never did that. But, um, I don't think teens fool about as much as they did when I was young. I mean, a lot of them seem to have computers at home these days and they, they spend their time on the computer playing games or, or net surfing on the Internet. Um, so I think, I think they, they, they maybe stay in a bit more.
