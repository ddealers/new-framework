										| This disc is the second volume of Sculthorpe's complete works for string quartets, recorded in the presence of the composer. Included is the String Quartet No 10, written in 1983 for the Kronos Quartet and displaying musical influences "from both sides of the Pacific." It is balanced by the String Quartet No 11 of 1990 which is distinctively Australian in feeling and, with the sub-title "Jabiru Dreaming," is one of the composer's "Kakadu" works.
										p
											| Both are very approachable, and receive committed and finely-shaped performances which capture effectively the essential elements of the music. With the composer's supervision the performances can be regarded as definitive.
											p
												| The disc also offers ten small pieces for string quartet, two of them miniatures called Hill-Songs, and the remainder drawn from unpublished or discarded works. With equally fine and carefully crafted performances, they provide, with the full-scale quartets, a constantly interesting survey of Sculthorpe's music for string quartet from 1945 to 1994.
