						b Are You Having the Same Argument?
						br
						p
							| Do you ever get the feeling you are having the same argument? Joe and I do. Often it feels like we have the same fights time and
							| time again without ever resolving them. A typical fight might go something like this (we each provided our own sub-texts):
							p
								b Me:
								| "Are we going up to visit Bob and Jean next weekend or not?"
								| (I don't really want to go, but I'm trying to find out what he wants first.)
								br
								b Joe:
								| "I don't know. I'll have to wait and see how things are at work."
								| (Don't hassle me. Why do we have to decide now, anyway? It's only Tuesday.)
								br
								b Me:
								| "But I have to tell them something. It's Tuesday already and they need to know."
								| (I feel obliged to let them know what we're doing so I can make other plans if we're not going away.)
								br
								b Joe:
								| "Well, do you want to go?" (If it's an issue, then you decide. Don't try and start an argument.)
								br
								b Me:
								| "I don't mind." (I don't want to go, but I know we should. Maybe I want Joe to make the decision.)
								br
								b Joe:
								| "I'll let them know later in the week." (I'm not ready to decide and I don't like being pushed.)
								br
								b Me:
								| "That's not fair to them." (That's not fair to me.)
								br
								b Joe:
								| "Look, I can't tell you now, because I don't know what's happening at work."
								| (I'm going to be really uncooperative now, because I don't like being pressured.)
								br
								b Me:
								| "Well, when will you know exactly?" (I'm going to tee you off now anyway, because you're just doing this to wind me up.)
								br
								p
									| By now we're in full fight mode and have reached a stalemate.
									| The more I hassle Joe to make a decision, the more stubborn he becomes - and the more stubborn he becomes, the more I hassle him.
									| Joe and I know our parts word for word, and we know we're going nowhere.
									| We usually end up with the traditional storming-out and door-slamming routine.
									p
										| According to Deborah Tannen, sociolinguist and author of That's Not What I Meant (Virago, £5.99),
										| these repeated arguments are the inevitable result of different arguing styles.
										| While women tend to be over-accommodating, many men resist the slightest hint that anyone,
										| especially a woman, is telling them what to do. This is due to what Tannen calls "cultural difference."
										p
											| "Male-female conversation is always cross-cultural communication," she says.
											| "Men and women have different past experiences. From the moment they're born they're treated and talked to differently,
											| and they talk differently themselves as a result."
											p
												| This partly explains my feeling that Joe and I are forever having the same row. We may be arguing over different things,
												| but it's always in the same way. It's our incompatible individual styles getting us into the same circular fight on any subject that comes up.
												p
													| So why do many of us end up with partners who have such a different arguing style?
													| Because opposites do attract. Even though in the long term we'd be better off with a partner we can communicate with,
													| initially we are drawn to someone who is our total opposite.
													p
														| "So, Joe, about next weekend. Have you had any more thoughts...?"
