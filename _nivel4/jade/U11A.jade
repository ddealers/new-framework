								| Making a House into a Home
								p
									| This month's House and Home looks at Feng Shui, the 3000 year-old Chinese art of living harmoniously in our homes.
							p
								| Have you ever gone into a neighbor's house and felt immediately "at home"?
								| Or you walk into an office or building and feel uncomfortable, but you don't know why.
								| You could be experiencing the effects of Feng Shui.
								p
									| The Chinese believe all things contain energy. Feng Shui, meaning "wind and water", is the art of organizing buildings
									| to use this energy positively. It can have an effect on our homes, relationships and work, too.
									| Use our guide to improve your homeand life!

												| Living room
						br
						| This room contains two conflicting elementsfire and water. Because of this, the stove and the sink shouldn't be close together.
						| Don't put the stove in a corner or in front of a large window. Ideally, the stove also won't be across from the door.
						| The room should be rectangular or squareirregular shapes have a negative effect on the flow of energy.
						| A spacious room with good light is perfect.

														| Living room
								br
								| Don't put objects that reflect across from the bedthis includes mirrors and televisions.
								| The bed shouldn't face the doorput it diagonally opposite.
								| If you live in a house on two floors this room shouldn't be above the garage or the kitchen.
								| Don't put any plants here. Don't put the bed next to a window or your spirit might leave the house while you're asleep!

																| Living room
										br
										| This room is important because it is where we entertain guests and friends.
										| Lots of light, space and natural colors are best. Don't fill it with too much furniture.
										| Don't put the room near the main door of the house or under the staircase.
										| Tables should be ovalnothing square with sharp edges and again, as with the bedroom, no mirrors!

																		| Living room
												br
												| The most important consideration here is the room's location in the house.
												| If possible, go for a bathroom that doesn't face the front door of your house.
												| With houses on two floors it's better not to have this room above the main entrance to the house.
												| If mirrors are bad in the bedroom they certainly aren't here it's the perfect place for them.
