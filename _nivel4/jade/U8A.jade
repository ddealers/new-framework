								| Dear Stella:
								br
								| The people I work with hate me. Ever since I joined the company two years ago, the other people in the office have treated me like poison. At meetings, I'm rarely asked my opinion, and when I say something nobody listens to me. I tell a joke and they roll their eyes. They all go out for lunch together, buy each other birthday presents and cards...and forget about me. When I can, I offer to help them with their work, but they never offer to help me. I get along with my boss, who says the other employees are probably jealous. He advises me to ignore the problem and focus on my work. But how can I do this? Please help me. What can I do?

														| Dear Stella:
														br
														| My first year of medical school has been stressful, tiring and boring. I've hated every minute of it! I don't want to study medicine! I'm here because my father wants me to be a doctor. He says he knows what is best for me. He never went to college. He says that this is his biggest regret in life, that he has always wanted to be a doctor. I'm depressed and l miss my friends back home. But if I drop out of medical school, Dad will be disappointed in me forever. How can I escape this situation?

While he was there he met someone, who he says he is going to marry. I can't believe it. I'm devastated! The worst thing is, he didn't even tell me to my faceÂ—he broke up with me by e-mail. This is the third relationship that has finished unexpectedly. What am I doing wrong? What should I do?

																					| Dear Naomi,
																					br
																					| Although nobody likes to feel excluded, I don't think you want this unfriendly group of people as your friends. You complained to the boss. Now they see you as a threat. What should you do? Confrontation would probably only antagonize them more. A better plan of action is to ignore their rude, childish behavior. Why don't you try to find friends outside this group? Do your work and take a good book to read at lunchtime!

																										| Dear Archie,
																										br
																										| Your happiness is the most important thing in life. Parents should appreciate their children for who they are! Your father envies your opportunities in life and is thinking more about himself than of you. Taking care of your father's regrets is not your responsibility! Consider taking a year off from medical school. Travel, find a job, think about what you'd like to be and how you'd like to live. If you ultimately decide to drop out of medical school permanently, try not to worry about your father's disappointment. That's his problem.

																																| Dear Anthea,

																																| Don't think this is your fault. You just picked the wrong man. There is, of course, no limit to how many times this can happen. If I were you, I would forget him; throw away any pictures of him or letters; give away any tapes or CD's you listened to together; delete his address from your e-mail address book. Don't be tempted to contact him. You should feel sorry for the woman stuck with a coward who uses email to end a relationship. You ought to think of this, not as an end, but as a new beginning.
