							| Torquay or Turkey? A small difference in pronunciation but a big difference for Kumiko Tsuchida, a Japanese tourist in England.
							| She ended up in Torquay when she was trying to get to Turkey.
				tr
					td(colspan='2')
						| It all started when Mrs. Tsuchida, who had been visiting a friend in London, set out for Heathrow to catch a flight to Istanbul.
						| Somewhere she took a wrong turn and ended up in Reading. Mrs. Tsuchida, aged 40, does not speak much English. When she tried to ask directions she was misunderstood. Instead of being re-directed to Heathrow, where her flight to Turkey was waiting, she was put on the 8:15 train to Torquay.
						p
							| On arrival, her attempts to find Istanbul's famous Pera Palace Hotel fell on deaf ears.
							| By the time the police found her it was two in the morning and she was wandering the streets.
							| According to the police she genuinely believed she was in Turkey. "She had been on the train so long she thought she was in Istanbul," said a police spokesman. "She even thought she had been through the Channel Tunnel."
							p
								| Police called social services, who found a bed for Mrs. Tsuchida in a local old people's home.
								| The next day she was put in touch with a travel agent, who arranged for her to get back to Reading where a Japanese embassy official met her. From there she was guided to Heathrow, and, finally, Turkey.
