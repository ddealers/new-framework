						| "Face Facts"
					p
						b A:
						| Our first guest today is Sandra Myers, who's come to tell us about her work as a personologist. Sandra, good afternoon.
						p
							b B:
							| Hi.
							p
								b A:
								| Sandra, I'm sure many of our listeners are asking themselves the same question: What exactly IS personology?
								p
									b B:
									| Well, personology is what some people refer to as face reading. The idea is that from looking at a person's facial features you can find out a lot about the type of person they are. Very few people in Britain have heard of personology, but in the United States it's taken very seriously and is now recognized as a science.
									p
										b A:
										| Could you tell us how it works?
										p
											b B:
											| OK. Well, the idea is that the shape of a person's facial features, and the dimensions of their face, are directly related to their personality. For example, if a person's eyes are close together, they are probably short tempered. People with thick lips are usually talkative, and people with long upper lips tend to be sarcastic. Someone's hair can also tell you a lot about them. Senstive people tend to have fine hair, whereas those with thick hair tend to be less emotional.
											p
												b A:
												| Fascinating. So what type of problems do you deal with?
												p
													b B:
													| A lot of people come to me because they are unhappy at work. By examining their face I can determine what their strengths and weaknesses are and recommend jobs that would match their personalities better. And lots of my clients come to me for advice about their relationships.
													p
														b A:
														| And what can you tell from looking at my face?
														p
															b B:
															| Well, one thing stands out, and that is that the two sides of your face are very similar. The right-hand side of your face represents your father's features, whereas the left-hand side of your face reflects your mother's traits. If there is a big difference between the two sides, a person tends to be moody. But because your face is very balanced, that suggests that you are quite the opposite. You're a calm, cheerful person.
