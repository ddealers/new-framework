Tom: Well, I got on the bus and I started reading the paper. Then suddenly I looked up and didn't know where I was. I mean, 
I thought I had passed my stop.

Sally: <sub>3</sub><input size=20 name="q2c">?<br><br>
Tom: I tired to get off the bus, but somehow my bag got caught on an elderly
woman's shopping bag. I was half out the door, pulling my bag and the woman was
pulling hers. We couldn't separate them. Some people on the bus got up to help and the driver
got out of this seat to see what was going on. <sub>4</sub><input size=20 name="q2d">, we eventually got the bags
apart.

 got off the bus I looked up and saw that it
wasn't even my bus. I had taken the wrong bus and I wasn't anywhere near my office.
