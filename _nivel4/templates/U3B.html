<b>1. Read about three people talking about the possibility of going on a vacation to the Moon.</b>
<p>
<center>
<b>"Fly Me To The Moon"</b>
</center>
<b>Speaker one </b>
<p>
"I imagine that the moon is not a very nice place. Erm, I imagine the climate would be very cold and also it would be boring.
 A big problem  would be you can't leave when you want to. 
So I think going to the moon for me is definitely not my ideal vacation."
<p>
<b>Speaker two </b>
<p>
"Erm, I always find flying a little traumatic, and I think flying in a rocket would be even more traumatic since. 
Erm, I guess once you're there on the moon it could be interesting, interesting views, but for me I think I'd find them a little, a little dull, maybe kinf of depressing. Erm, I like to walk in nature, you know. I like to hear waves breaking on the beach, birds singing and see the sun setting and all that. I don't think that's what I would get if I went to the moon." 
<p>
<b>Speaker three </b>
<p>
"Yes, I'd go to the moon on a vacation. The views of the earth would be amazing. I'd like to leave the earth and get away from the effects of gravity, to be able to jump incredibly high. I think I'd find the journey there very frightening, but all in all it would be a great experience."
