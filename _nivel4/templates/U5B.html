<form id="t1">
<b>1. Forming and using the passive: informal and formal style</b>
<p>
Passive sentences have this form: <span id="m1"><b>to be</b></span> (in the correct tense) + <b>past participle</b>
<p>
<b>Present Perfect Passive</b> sentences have this form: <span id="m1">have/has + been</span> + <b>past participle</b>
<p>
<span id="m1">
<li>Mr. Hann <b>has been fired.</b> 
<li>Things <b>have been stolen</b> from their house. 
</span>
<p>
<b>Simple Past passive</b> sentences have this form: <span id="m1">was/were</span> + <b>past participle </b>
<p>
<span id="m1">
<li>Their house <b>was broken into</b> while they were on vacation. 
<li>Many objects of worth <b>were stolen</b> from their house.</span>
<p> 


Passive sentences are often used in more formal contexts, for example in newspaper reports. In conversation, you often use <span id="m1"><b>someone</b></span> or <span id="m1"><b>they</b></span> as a subject to avoid the passive.

<p>
<span id="m1">
<li><b>"Someone</b> stole our video when we were on vacation!" </span>(Mr.. Hann's words) 
<p>
<span id="m1">
<li>Mr. Hann's video <b>was stolen</b> when he was on vacation. </span>(from a newspaper report) 
<p>
<span id="m1">
<li>"<b>They</b> told me I'd lost my job."</span> (Mr. Hann's words) 
<span id="m1">
<li>Mr. Hann's <b>was told</b> he had lost his job. </span>(from a newspaper report)
